# Coding-Challenges

A simple repository consisting of various coding challenges implemented in different languages

I have created this repository so as to create a single sourcce for various coding challenges along with their solutions in various languages.You can also contribute the newer coding challenges.Just add to the issues with topic as challenge:new challenge.THis will be helpful for everyone and also many programmers can get the challenges in the languages they are getting.

The format must be as follows-
a. Add a readme.md file which describes what the problem is along with the algorithm.
b. Create a directory whose name is the language for your implementation and inside it all the assets will be there.
